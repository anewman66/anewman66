- 👋 Hi, I’m @anewman66, or just Alex if you prefer.
- 👀 I’m interested in Cancer Genomics and Bioinformatics, and a hell of a lot else; I dabble in CAD and 3D printing, and even Unity and VR sometimes.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the various ways of investigating complex abnormalities in cancer from whole genome sequencing data, and I'm having a great time getting to grips with long read nanopore sequencing technology.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that can improve the outcomes for people with cancer. I have a keen interest in GBM and paediatric lymphoma!
- 📫 How to reach me send me a message on here, or catch me on twitter @AlexNewmanUK
