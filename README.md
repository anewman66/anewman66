- 👋 Hi, I’m @anewman66, or just Alex to most humans.
- 👀 I’m interested in Cancer Genomics and Bioinformatics, just about anything involving cutting-edge technology that can help people.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the various ways of investigating complex abnormalities in cancer from whole genome sequencing data, and I'm having a great time getting to grips with long read nanopore sequencing technology.
- 🎛 At home I enjoy making devices to make my life and the lives of others easier, usually utilising CAD and 3D printing alongside microcontrollers and Raspberry Pi computers. I've even been dabbling Unity and VR.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that can improve the outcomes for people with cancer. I have a particular interest in GBM and paediatric lymphoma but want to work wherever I can help people.
- 📫 To reach me send me a message on here, go to my [website](bioalex.co.uk) or catch me on  Threads @AlexNewmanUK
